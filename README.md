# projectalpha

This is basically a simple static website that touches on responsiveness across several devices.
It was designed with HTML5 and CSS3 only.
A beta version where the JS file will be added will be uploaded soonest.
I made use of floats as I found it easy to work with.
I have noticed however, that although at 1024px via Google dev tools, the webiste remains responsive, 
at full screen mood, it feels like the website isn't. (At least on my machine)
I will go further in the beta modification to treat this gliche and ensure everything aligns
I started from 425px in the design, probably why the entire thing became messy
I usually start at 320px.


It was inspired by one of the w3 templates but designed entirely by me.
